# ðŸ§© Wireframing

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

**Wireframing** is the process of creating simplified visual representations of a user interface. It is a key step in the UI/UX design process that helps designers, developers, and stakeholders align on the structure and functionality of a system before development begins.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Wireframing is Important

Wireframes serve as a blueprint for the digital product, providing clarity on:

- **Layout and structure**: They show how content and elements will be arranged on the screen.
- **User interaction**: Wireframes help visualize user flow and functionality without distraction from design details.
- **Communication**: They act as a communication tool between designers, developers, and clients, ensuring everyone shares the same vision early on.
- **Efficiency**: Identifying issues in structure or navigation during the wireframing stage saves time and cost compared to changes during development.

Whether you're building a website, mobile app, or dashboard, wireframes are essential to ensure a user-centered, efficient, and successful design process.
